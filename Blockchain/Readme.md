## Resources

#### Basics
- [Blockchain Basics: A Non-Technical Introduction in 25 Steps](https://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-Basics-Non-Technical-Introduction-Steps/dp/1484226038)
    - This is a very good book for introducing Blockchain and its concept in an easy, step-by-step manner, with no specifics to any blockchain. You will acquire the necessary concepts before entering the dark forest. This book will not be outdated.
    - This book inspires the beginning of the presentation (all content before Ethereum)
- [The Internet of Money: A collection of talks by Andreas M. Antonopoulos](https://www.amazon.com/Internet-Money-Andreas-M-Antonopoulos/dp/1537000454)
    - I can not recommend reading this book enough. This book does not explain the **how** of Bitcoin, it delves into the **why** of bitcoin. A very good, non-technical book that will open your mind (there are new volumes of the book).

#### Ethereum
- [Mastering Ethereum: Building Smart Contracts and DApps](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Ethereum-Building-Smart-Contracts/dp/1491971940)
    - Most of the old Ethereum developers started from this book. Although some chapters are outdated, a new version will be released early in 2025.
- [Ethereum Developer Docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/)
    - Ethereum docs is a really good place to get familiar with all Ethereum underlying concepts.
- [Ethereum 2.0 book](https://eth2book.info/)
    - This book is too technical and advanced, it explains the underlyings of new Ethereum's consensus: Proof Of Stake. Do not read this book if you're not familiar with Ethereum development and blockchain technology.
- [Cyfrin Updraft](https://www.cyfrin.io/updraft)
    - This platform contains free resources for Smart contracts development. The best you can find.

> There are plenty of resources out there that I can't list all here as it will become overwhelming. The above resources are meant as a start gateway. After you enter the dark forest, you will be veteran enough to know what to learn next and from where.
